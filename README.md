# ImGuiEditor
This is a small 2D/3D rendering project using Dear ImGui for the user interface. I created this to learn how to use Dear ImGui and understand immediate graphical user interfaces better. I also see it as an opportunity to brush up on my OpenGL knowledge, and my C++ skills.

## Acknowledgements
I'd like to thank the maintainers and contributors of the [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) project
